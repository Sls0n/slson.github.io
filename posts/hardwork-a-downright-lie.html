          >
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          This statement is a downright lie that is deeply rooted in our minds.
          Inculcating hard work into us has been a constant theme throughout
          history. Why are there hardly any examples of hard-working laborers
          being rich if it is so paramount? However, there are abundant examples
          of the rich gaining exorbitant profit merely by exploiting them.<br />
          <br />

          <span>
            "Having been indoctrinated with something does not ensure its
            validity. Thus, it is not logical to regard something as true merely
            because it has been indoctrinated into us."
          </span>
          <br /><br />

          We recklessly trust what we are indoctrinated with because, as a
          child, our brain cannot discern right and wrong. Thus, we still follow
          countless ridiculous & absurd beliefs. <br />
          <br />

          The hard workers who do all the work are paid only a tiny fraction of
          what the wealthy earn. The one who works hard gets stuck in a rat race
          with all the daily drudgery and tedious work. Meanwhile, the rich
          reward themselves with fancy cars & travel around the world for all
          the hard work they did not do. Even the mere thought of buying a fancy
          car might seem practically impractical for the workers.<br />
          <br />

          Nevertheless, knowing all this, why do we willingly relinquish our
          hopes and dreams just for a mediocre job? Because we are inculcated to
          do so? Because it is the right thing to do? I am not blaming riches
          for this. We are wholly accountable for our misery. No one forced us
          to work for the riches, right? And yet here we are whining about how
          we are exploited, showing hate out of righteous indignation, and
          condemning all the time. <br /><br />

          People blame others/something for their misery to delude themselves
          into thinking they are not accountable for it. Blaming is easy and
          might feel good, but all it does is imperceptibly trap us in our
          self-delusional bubble, making us incapable of ameliorating our
          misery. Playing the victim or self-victimization is something we do as
          a coping strategy.<br /><br />

          Nevertheless, still, I admit that hard work is a significant aspect of
          acquiring success. You cannot expect to become wealthy just by resting
          on the couch and watching Netflix the whole day just because a wannabe
          writer on the internet said so. In the initial paragraph, I discussed
          how hard workers working for the rich are taken advantage of by
          insidious means. Regardless, we must work tenaciously to get to the
          point where we can exploit those hard workers ourselves by being rich.
          We are all desirous & greedy creatures, after all.<br />
          <br />

          So let us get back to working hard. As I said, hard work is one of the
          significant aspects of acquiring wealth. However, the type of hard
          work we should do is more than just hard work. There is a subtle yet
          vast difference between hard work and perseverance/persistence. Let us
          take the instance of James & Jimmy. <br />
          <br />

          James was a hardworking man. He desired to become a musician. James
          worked relentlessly but noticed less progress than he anticipated. He
          began to regard learning music as a gamble for his career since he had
          reached nowhere. It completely drained his energy. So he chose to
          abandon learning music and do a simple job instead, which would pay
          him way less than what he would have achieved if he had been steady.
          Though he had a rigid working mindset & attitude, he lacked
          persistence. Thus, he could not endure the learning process leaving
          him with no alternatives. What he should have realized was that
          learning is a steep curve. He would have seen substantial improvement
          if he had not backed off so quickly. In a steep curve, you will not
          notice much improvement in the initial years, but the improvement will
          exponentially increase later.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, Jimmy, on the other hand, was also interested in music. He
          was not as hardworking but was persistent, unlike James. Jimmy did not
          witness notable progress in the initial years either, but he did not
          let that obliterate his ambition of becoming a musician. He kept on
          moving forward slowly but steadily. Eventually, he noticed his skill
          advancing exponentially to the point that he began getting multiple
          offers. This example of Jimmy & James depicts the vast distinction
          between working hard and being persistent.
          <br /><br />

          Okay, so persistence & perseverance is the key to becoming wealthy?
          No! Sorry to break it to you, but solely hard work will not let you
          anywhere. Let us assume it is just one-tenth of the thing that
          matters. There are countless other factors. Luck, Privilege, and
          Choice are some significant factors in getting rich. Luck is not
          tangible, so we think of it as something we lack authority over. We do
          not have control over our serendipity, but we make it unnoticeably for
          ourselves. The more discipline we have, the more luck we accumulate.
          The choices we make in our life have a profound influence on our
          future, but we are completely oblivious when we make them. Even a
          trivial choice will have a drastic unintentional effect on our life.
          This phenomenon is often called the "ripple effect," and choices have
          a ripple effect.
