          I mean, No shit? We're human, it's what we do. What's more ludicrous
          is that our brain delightfully devours every lies we try to feed it,
          it must really like being lied to. Have you noticed how blatant lies
          in your head slowly morph into oblivious truth? It's practically
          impractical to not fall for your own shameless lies. I used to think
          that the brain is hard to deceive, but boy I was utterly unaware of
          how easy it is. Constantly lying to ourselves leads to a state of
          self-delusion, causing a distorted view of actuality. With time, we
          become more accustomed to accepting our own lies. With our own lies,
          we become convinced that we are the victim and have been denied
          justice. This is precisely why playing the blame game is a go-to
          resolution to feel good and avoid responsibility. This is exactly the
          weird incentive behind being a victim, even though we are the ones who
          commenced the inevitable fuckening. Self-victimization turns one into
          a perpetual victim, denying accountability and guilt for their own
          apparent mistakes. Here are some examples of it:
          <br />
          <br />

          <span class="span-italic span-bold">
            "I am poor, but it's not my fault! The whole game is rigged. Fuck
            capitalism!"
          </span>
          <br /><br />

          <span class="span-italic span-bold">
            "I got into an accident. I was driving thoroughly like a good
            law-abiding citizen, but all of a sudden, this clown came out of
            thin air and crashed right into my ass!"
          </span>
          <br /><br />

          <span class="span-italic span-bold">
            "There's no way I failed this test. Even lord can't fathom how
            possibly an outright genius like me could have failed. It's merely
            the paper maker's fault. He made the questions tougher than a
            titanium alloy. Why would anyone do that?"
          </span>
          <br /><br />

          Okay! I reckon now you have a solid grasp of the blame game with the
          above examples. If you don't, maybe it's time to get a brain scan and
          see if there's anything funky going on up there. Or have
          self-proclaimed intellectuals of Reddit & twitter explain to you like
          you're a toddler or something. I mean, the examples I gave were
          impeccable, clearly not my fault. I might as well be speaking to my
          imaginary girlfriend now. At least she exists in my imagination,
          unlike your brain. Just kidding, this was another bonus example for
          all of you. But if you still don't get it, I won't waste my time
          explaining it to someone whose IQ is lower than the temperature in
          Antarctica.
          <span class="span-italic span-bold"
            >Just kidding again, or am I?
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />

          These examples show what most of us do when faced with adversity - we
          divert it away, either by blaming or by being the victim. The relation
          between blaming and being the victim is convoluted yet so simple. By
          blaming others for your problem, you become the victim. You are
          essentially saying that you are not responsible for your own
          circumstances and that you are at the mercy of someone else's actions
          or behaviors.<br />
          <br />

          People blame others/something for their misery to delude themselves
          into thinking they are not accountable for it. Blaming is easy and
          might feel good, but all it does is imperceptibly entangle us in our
          self-delusional bubble, making us incapable of ameliorating our
          misery. Playing the victim or self-victimization is something we do as
          a coping strategy to momentarily forget our problems, and constantly
          doing so exposes us to the unapparent perils of it.<br /><br />

          A constant sense of victimhood traps you in a state of perpetual
          indignation. You won't strive for change anymore since it's clearly
          not your fault. You'll be too engaged in finding something to condemn
          in order to boost your self-righteousness. Blaming is as compulsive as
          drugs, which creates a massive dopamine surge in the brain due to
          which you want to do it more and more and more and well, more.<br /><br />

          Let's take an instance of you arriving at the office late, is it your
          fault? Oh hell yeah it is... I mean, it's not. Wtf! It's clearly the
          busy traffic.
          <span class="span-italic"
            >"Dang it, boss, I literally got stuck in that mess for an hour. I
            am so unlucky, ughh"</span
          >. And the funniest part is that you're probably more convinced by
          your own lie than your boss is, which then leads to you becoming the
          victim. Blame all the time, and you'll find yourself cursing gravity
          for your downfall one day. I mean if it wasn't for gravity then you
          wouldn't fall, right? Or maybe it's the newton's fault for inventing
          gravity. Or maybe it's the fault of the person who invented newton. Or
          maybe it's the fault of the person who invented the person who
          invented newton. The possibilities are endless. You can blame anything
          and everything for your problems, but the truth is that you are solely
          responsible for every problems and you are the one to be blamed.

          <br /><br />
          One of the most powerful roman emperors, also a stoic philosopher,
          Marcus Aurelius, once said: "Choose not to be harmed - and you won't
          feel harmed. Don't feel harmed - and you haven't been." You can't
          control everything that happens to you, but you can control how you
          choose to react to it. Choose to be a victim, and you'll entangle
          yourself in a perpetual state of victimhood. Or choose to acknowledge
          your mistakes, admit the fact that it's only you who can fix it
          regardless of who is at fault, and you'll be able to keep on
          consolidating yourself. You can either bury your head in the sand and
          live a life of self-delusion or you can embrace the fact that you are
          constantly going to find yourself getting fucked over by trivial
          problems. If you choose the latter, always remember that trivial
          problems are trivial. Either live as a victim or live as a victor. The
          choice is yours.
